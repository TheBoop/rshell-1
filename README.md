#Rshell
##intro
This is a BASH shell terminal where the user can use 
all commands that are in the .bin directory in the actual 
terminal. You can run programs within the rshell. You cannot, 
however change directories. The cd command is not part of 
the .bin directory. We will be implementing that in the future.

##instalation
you need to type these commands into the bash shell
'''
$ git clone  https://github.com/yourusername/rshell.git
$ cd rshell
$ git checkout hw0
$ make
$ bin/rshell
'''


##BUGS

on the same line 
tab in the beginning causes an infinite loop
